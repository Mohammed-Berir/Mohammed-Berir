### Hi there, ðŸ‘‹
I am a researcher in applied mathematics at the Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science at Al-Baha University ([Al-Baha](https://bu.edu.sa/en/web/faculty-of-science/). My research interests mainly lie in applied mathematics, analysis, and mathematical modeling. I have published twentyâ€‘eight refereed scientific articles in highâ€‘quality mathematical journals (Q1, SCI). I coâ€‘wrote these papers with renowned mathematicians like Professors Rania Saadeh, Mohammed A. Abdoon, and Ahmad Qazza. I have a deep passion for quantitative methods and Python programming. I regularly serve as a peer reviewer for
several journals, such as Nonlinear Dynamics (Q1, SCI, IFâ€‘5.2) and Chaos (AIP Publishingâ€”USA).
